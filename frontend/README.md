# Chatty - ChatGPT clone

## Tips
- **For: Large Screens [`Laptops | Desktop`]**
  > If you hold `shift` and press the `up arrow` or `down arrow` button while focused of the TextBox [`input`], you can cycle through your previous prompt. **NOTE:** *This only works if you have entered some prompts previously in the current session*

- The `flash` icon is used to format a messages that contains links into a clickable link rather than just a text link.

- Chatty stores previous chats in the users localstorage in order to persist them so that when the use returns back to the chat it can still show previous messages and prompts.
- You can delete any chat by double clicking on the chat box. Note this might not work in all chat. 😉
